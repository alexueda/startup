# Project Update: Sharenote Web Pages

## Pages Created:
- **about.html**: Provides information about Sharenote, explaining its purpose and how users can share to-do lists and notes.
- **createroom.html**: A page where users can create a room with a password, allowing them to invite family and friends to collaborate.
- **index.html**: The main landing page of the Sharenote website, linking to other key pages.
- **setting.html**: A page that allows users to adjust their account or room settings.
- **sharenote.html**: The main functionality page where users can share lists and notes between family and friends in real-time.

## Features Added:
- All pages are interconnected with navigation links.
- A GitHub link is added in the footer section of each page for easy access to the project repository.
- The pages are deployed using a script (`deployFiles.sh`) on my domain, ensuring easy updates and deployment of changes.

## Deployment:
- The project is deployed via the `deployFiles.sh` script, which automates the process of uploading files to my domain.
